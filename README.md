# Traffic-Controller

Smart Traffic controller.

The main objective of the system is to control traffic congestion problems. In this system, the traffic signal lights are controlled by PLC with reference to the vehicle density on the road.Â The system developed is able to sense the presence of vehicles within certain range and to set an appropriate duration for the traffic signals to react accordingly. By employing mathematical functions, appropriate time can be calculated for the signals to illuminate, and thus traffic can be controlled.
